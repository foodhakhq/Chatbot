## üåç Environments

- **Production** API: `https://ai-foodhak.com`
- **Staging** API: `https://staging.ai-foodhak.com`

## üö¶ How It Works

1. **Start a Session:**  
   - Client POSTs to `/chat/start_session` with user info.
   - Receives a unique `session_key` and `websocket_url`.
2. **Chat via WebSocket:**  
   - Connect to `websocket_url`.
   - Send plain text messages for conversational nutrition Q&A.
   - Receive real-time, streaming JSON responses.
3. **End a Session:**  
   - POST to `/chat/end_session` to clean up the session.

All requests must include an **Authorization** header:  
`Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`
